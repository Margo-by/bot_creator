TEXT TO SPEECH

Generate spoken audio from input text
```
from pathlib import Path
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

speech_file_path = Path(__file__).parent / "speech.mp3"
response = client.audio.speech.create(
  model="tts-1",
  voice="alloy",
  input="Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!"
)

response.stream_to_file(speech_file_path)
```
By default, the endpoint will output a MP3 file of the spoken audio but it can also be configured to output any of our supported formats.


SPEECH TO TEXT

The transcriptions API takes as input the audio file you want to transcribe and the desired output file format for the transcription of the audio. We currently support multiple input and output file formats.

Transcribe audio
```
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

audio_file= open("/path/to/file/audio.mp3", "rb")
transcription = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
  model="whisper-1", 
  file=audio_file
)
print(transcription.text)
```
By default, the response type will be json with the raw text included.

{
  "text": "Imagine the wildest idea that you've ever had, and you're curious about how it might scale to something that's a 100, a 1,000 times bigger.
....
}
The Audio API also allows you to set additional parameters in a request. For example, if you want to set the response_format as text, your request would look like the following:

Additional options
```
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

audio_file = open("/path/to/file/speech.mp3", "rb")
transcription = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
  model="whisper-1", 
  file=audio_file, 
  response_format="text"
)
print(transcription.text)
```
The API Reference includes the full list of available parameters.

Translations
The translations API takes as input the audio file in any of the supported languages and transcribes, if necessary, the audio into English. This differs from our /Transcriptions endpoint since the output is not in the original input language and is instead translated to English text.

Translate audio
```
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

audio_file= open("/path/to/file/german.mp3", "rb")
translation = client.audio.translations.create(
  model="whisper-1", 
  file=audio_file
)
print(translation.text)
```
